## About the Project
This project prompts the user to enter in any string that he or she would like.  Afterwards, the user is prompted with a menu displaying many options that enable to the user to manipulate the string.  The user can continue to manipulate his or her string until the user decides to quit the program.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* demonstrate understanding of writing function definitions and calling functions within main
* amalgamate the current acquired knowledge of Python, such as input/output, if/elif/else statements, loops, random number generation, lists, and functions into one program

In this program, the user can enter anything, even when prompted with entering an integer menu selection, and the program will still function as intended. 

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
